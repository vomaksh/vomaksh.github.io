    Last Updated: 26 August 2024

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      Welcome to HN Pocket. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy
      explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when
      you use our Android application.
    </p>

    <h3>Information We Collect and Use</h3>

    <p>
      For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to
      provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The
      information that I request will be retained on your device and is not
      collected by me in any way.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

    <p>
      HN Pocket may use third-party services such as Google Analytics to analyze
      app usage and performance. These services may collect information about
      your device and how you interact with the app, but this data is used in
      aggregate form and does not identify individual users.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect the information you provide to us
      through HN Pocket. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or
      method of electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to use
      commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee
      its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>
      I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised
      to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
